# Statcast Pitcher Velocity Distribution

The baseball savant web application replicated in this project is the 'Statcast Pitcher Velocity Distribution'. The goal of the web app is to visualize the frequency of all pitch types by pitch speed made by a certain pitcher in a certain year. The web app will make it easy to see how common / uncommon a certain pitch type is and how common / uncommon a certain pitch speed for that pitch type is. The web app will be able to show all pitch types or just the types manually chosen. The years that are able to be chosen range from 2008 - 2021 depending on which years the pitcher has played.

Before testing the web app, install dash by typing the following command in your terminal (pip install dash). To begin testing the web application, the python file must be opened and run in the terminal by typing ($python app.py) in your terminal. Copy the ip address http://127.0.0.1:8050 into your browser to open the app.
